So I got bored the other day and went looking for something to randomly watch, and stumbled across this absolute gem of a machinima, “Freeman’s Mind”, in it’s own words;

> Follow the thoughts of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a 27 year old physicist and neurotic individual.

I’ve not laughed so much at an online video for a long, long time.
You can find the first video below, and the rest at [http://www.machinima.com/series/view&id=187](http://www.machinima.com/series/view&id=187) [http://civil-protection.blogspot.com](http://civil-protection.blogspot.com/) (The author’s original work (worth a look) and current base for FM) || [http://accursedfarms.com](http://accursedfarms.com) (Soon to be home for FM)

In order to fill the gap between the updates the Spin-Off “Barney’s Mind” (Blueshift) appeared, and it’s just as good;

Now without further ado, if you’re still wondering whether or not to watch these series’, just give it a go:
