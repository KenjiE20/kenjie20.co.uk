New versions of highmon and chanmon, both now synced to version 1.6.  
This version added colours to channel names for both scripts. Colour's can either be  
off - default text colour  
on - generated from buffer name  
fixed - A user definable single colour

As always, find them in the [Downloads](/downloads/) section or via weechat/weeget.
