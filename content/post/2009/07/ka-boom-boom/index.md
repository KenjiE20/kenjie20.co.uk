So the site fell off the net. It's not like anyone _actually_ cares.. right?

\-Technical stuff follows- In case you were wondering, my hoster's fell a foul of the VPS issue a while back, they've now fixed that, but it's taken some time to figure out what's gone and what's recoverable.

Seems like the SQL DB's have gone, and I was stupid and missed backing up. But all is not lost, this old backup will suffice for now, and I have the source for the other pages thanks to Google Cache.

So over the next week I should get this back, maybe with restored images, maybe not, and after that, I _might_ actually have some new crud to put up.
