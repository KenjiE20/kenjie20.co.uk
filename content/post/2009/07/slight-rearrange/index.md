I've had a reshuffle in layout terms, to coincide with the new revenue making ProjectWonderful ad boxes, and hopefully it's as easy, or easier to navigate.  
The site zone's that were on the left, are now in the bar above, and darken depending where you are, and a few boxes have moved.

Oh and I bumped [rslap](/downloads/weechat-scripts/rslap/) up to v1.1, with a fix for comments and blank lines.

Also EVE got a funky new trailer, which I'm slotting in here, simply because I can;
