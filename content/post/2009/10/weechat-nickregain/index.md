Yet another new script for Weechat 0.3.0

nickregain, will automatically attempt to regain your most preferred nick for each server, by

1. using a command set, if you provide one,
2. detecting nick changes and quits, and finally
3. performing an /ison every x seconds (60 by default)

Version 1.0 is available [here](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/501502/nickregain.pl), and should soon pop up on weechat's plug-ins page, and weeget.  
Detailed info can be found under it's respective page in [Downloads](/downloads/)
