I happened across [this](http://aliceandkev.wordpress.com/) the other day in my internet wanderings. [Alice and Kev](http://aliceandkev.wordpress.com/) is an experiment in playing a homeless family in [The Sims 3](http://www.thesims3.com/).

The premise seems pretty basic on the face of it; Take the Sims 3, create a couple of characters (father/daughter in this case), set them up in a lot made up to look like an abandoned park, and see what happens, giving the odd nudge along the way.

What this has turned into, with the help of some good writing, is an incredible fascinating and moving story of these two characters. A lot of it driven by the game itself.

This is certainly worth reading through, but be warned, while there are some uplifting points, this is (by and large) a rather sad tale.
