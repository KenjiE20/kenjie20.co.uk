Due to popular demand for something similar to chanmon, for highlights, I've whipped up a new Weechat script Highmon. It's based off the core of chanmon, and shares a few features. Docs and latest version, will be updated in the [Downloads](../downloads/) section, and available through Weechat’s manager script ‘weeget’

Get Highmon v.1.0 \[ [dl](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/501502/chanmon.pl) \]
