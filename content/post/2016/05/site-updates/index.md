It's that time again. The current theme has served me well over the years, but it is not so friendly for mobile. The name Longbow's Lair, has also run its course, and it's time to re-brand it. Other than the name and theme though, most things won't change.

Oh and look out for another post soon, with my collection of photos from my recent trip to Japan.
