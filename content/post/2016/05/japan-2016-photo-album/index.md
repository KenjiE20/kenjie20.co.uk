Better late than never, here's my photo album from my visit to Japan, between 26th March, and 9th April

The trip took us from Sapporo, where I wanted to visit my grand fathers grave, then by train down to Hakodate. Then by air down to Tokyo for a few days, before hitting the Shinkansen to Osaka. Using Osaka as a base to also visit Himeji, Kyoto and Nara.
