no really, I'm not..

Okay, so I am REALLY overdue a post of some kind or another on here. Between work, PC upgrade, broken PC upgrades, console games, MMOs, broken phones, driving lessons, building a second PC, continued failing PC upgrades and watching anime, I guess I kinda forgot.

With any luck I shall explain the bizzarre goings on in a few posts over the next couple of days, right now however, it is 10:10pm and I should probably not be popping fruit gums like TicTacs, meh.

Look for posts soon (I hope)

Peace out
