Well tuesday was a complete waste. I took the afternoon off of work to view a new flat, but apparantly the estate agency couldn't be bothered to hang on the line long enough for my phone to go to answerphone, and because I work on the helpdesk, I can't return calls till after 5:00. guess when they shut. :x

So I've managed to re-arrange now so that I can get Ingo\_sleeps over there to check the place out on my behalf today, what a faff.

Also I read an interesting article on CNet about the state that Linux is in, RE: total beginners. Seems most of the time there is nothing decent in the way of advice or tutorials, for the really basic users, so to that end, I'mgoing to attempt to start writing some basic guides for beginners, that aren't horribly outdated.
