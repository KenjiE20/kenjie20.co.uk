.... well limping at any rate

I've somehow managed to cobble enough will and effort to get this thing back up and running once more..

Incase you weren't paying attention (probable) the site got hit by a hack attempt, long story short, I'm starting from scratch.

Thus expect to see a different approach to content on here, the main focus will probably be towards writings, blog and photo galleries. Old reviews will make it back, when I can be bothered to reformat them from the database archive.

For now I'm just gonna move this site to live and give up for now. TTFN
