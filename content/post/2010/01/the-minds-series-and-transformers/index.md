So over the holidays [Barney's Mind](http://barneysmind.blogspot.com/) ([YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/IRAMightyPirate#grid/user/8906695BE1FCF060)) reached its finale, and while [Freeman's](http://www.accursedfarms.com/) and [Shephard's Mind](http://www.shephardsmind.half-lifecreations.com/) ([YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/KrimsinYT#grid/user/9C5D30F8EF72D19A)) are busy being worked on, a rather awesome rendition of [Chell's Mind](http://cyhanide.blogspot.com/) (Portal) has appeared to fill the void ([YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xgncUYbzMA)).

Meanwhile, whilst sorting through my old collection of flash video files, I stumbled across the Transformers break-dancing short, by Mark Wilenkin and Lazer (amongst others). Since the original sites and video have long since disappeared from the 'net and the video is so good, I figured I'd re-post it here.

Please note; I take absolutely zero credit for any of this work, apart from re-hosting it.

Oh and I have a couple posts sitting around the Drafts waiting to be written properly, so hopefully more stuff soon.
