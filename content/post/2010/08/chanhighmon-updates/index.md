Okay, so I _may_ have neglected doing an update for a while. Well have a new version of [chanmon](/downloads/weechat-scripts/chanmon/) and [highmon](/downloads/weechat-scripts/highmon/) then.
By popular request, v2.1 now has an 'nchannel' option for alignment, to display both buffer numbers and channel names together.

As per usual changelogs, info and links in [Downloads](/downloads/) and should be available on [Weechatâ€™s page](http://www.weechat.org/scripts/) / via Weeget
