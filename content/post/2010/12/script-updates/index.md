Small bug fixes to nickregain, chanmon and highmon scripts;

nickregain v1.1.1
fix a corner case where $config{$name} didn't exist for a disconnecting server (thanks to idl0r)

chanmon v2.1.3
change /monitor to /chmonitor to avoid command conflicts (thanks m4v) (/chanmon monitor remains the same)

highmon v2.1.3
fix perl errors caused by bar line counter (thanks to idl0r)

chanmon & highmon
Add command help to /xxxxmon help

As usual new versions available from [Downloads](/downloads/) and [Weechat scripts](http://www.weechat.org/scripts/) / Weeget
