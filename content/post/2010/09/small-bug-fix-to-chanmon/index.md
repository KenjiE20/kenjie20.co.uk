Just a quick bug fix update to chanmon. It was failing to detect open buffers on more than one screen when using the 'dynmon' feature (thanks to m4v for report and fix)

The latest version is now 2.1.1 and will be available from [Downloads](/downloads/) and [Weechat scripts](http://www.weechat.org/scripts/) and Weeget
