So it's been a while since I posted anything here, and now there's 4 updates all at once, typical.

[Chanmon](/downloads/weechat-scripts/chanmon/) and [Highmon](/downloads/weechat-scripts/highmon/) both get bumped up to version 2.0, new things include;

- Selectable outputs, both sharing the same formatting
- Buffer logging toggle, no more giant chanmon log file
- config clean up (command), no longer requires all channels to be set in the config, you only need to set the ones you want off, the command should clean up the config from previous versions
- /monitor can now be given options, so you can toggle channels from another channel

[Nickregain](/downloads/weechat-scripts/nickregain/) goes to 1.1 with;

- Added a command delay, to delay sending the configured commands
- Big fix to occasionally leaking infolist
- Quit and nick changes should detect again

and finally [rslap](/downloads/weechat-scripts/rslap/) 1.3 with;

- Ability to add/remove strings from weechat
- Optional ability to slap a user back when they slap you

As usual full changelogs, info and dl links in [Downloads](/downloads/) and should be available on [Weechat's page](http://www.weechat.org/scripts/) / via Weeget

Oh and I have this [twitter](https://twitter.com/KenjiE20) thing, if anyone's even bothered.
