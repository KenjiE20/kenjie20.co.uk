This is still very much an alpha work in progress, and as of this moment (Sept '09) partially stalled. I say partially, as the main thing needed for this is more feedback on level layout and weapon placement. I _think_ the current layout makes for good playability, but I'm slightly biased, and have been staring at it for too long to really tell.
