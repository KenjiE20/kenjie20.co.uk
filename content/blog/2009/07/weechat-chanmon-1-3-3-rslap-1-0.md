I mentioned the "Channel Monitor" in the earlier Weechat post.

So here's Chanmon v.1.3.3 \[ [dl](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/501502/chanmon.pl) \]  
Which allows you to watch all/most/some of your IRC channels in a single buffer, without merging them.

And rslap v1.0 \[ [dl](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/501502/rslap.pl) \]  
Allows /rslap &lt;nick&gt; to slap a nick withÂ  a random pre-defined message

More info can be found under their respective pages in [Downloads](/downloads/)  
Both scripts are also available through Weechat's built-in manager script 'weeget'
