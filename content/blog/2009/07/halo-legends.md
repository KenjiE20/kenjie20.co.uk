So this got announced the other day too;

> The BONES, Casio Entertainment, Production I.G., Studio 4°C, and Toei Animation anime studios are animating Halo Legends, a DVD anthology of seven short films based on Microsoft Studios' Halo game franchise. Microsoft's creative staff is approving the visuals and storytelling. Three of the creative directors are Frank O'Connor of Microsoft's 343 Industries, Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed), and Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell, The Sky Crawlers)
