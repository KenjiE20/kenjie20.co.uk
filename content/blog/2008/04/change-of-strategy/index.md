Yeah, there is no way I'm ever gonna manage to keep updating this site. I just no longer have the urge to do so.

However, that doesn't mean I'll a) forget about it, or b) stop adding stuff. It just means that updates will be sporadic at best...

In the mean time, here a little something to tease you UT3 players;

(if you dont recognise the layout shame on you... It's CTF-Orbital BTW)

No pics from in-game yet, there's still a tonnage of naff, ugly bits.
