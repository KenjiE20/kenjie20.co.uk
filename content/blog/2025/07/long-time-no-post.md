Long time, no post. It’s been a while, between burnout (oof), trips to Japan (nice), the pandemic (oof 2), and some life (shit happens) things and a bit more travelling, things have been up and down.

Meantime my foray into homelabbing has gone from synology NAS running packages, to a bigger one, to Docker-all-the-things, which now seems fortuitous in light of the recent synology shenanigans.[^1] [^2] The next upgrade is likely going back to reusing old PCs in modern high storage capacity cases.

Finally I also switched this site over to a static site generator ([Hugo](https://gohugo.io)). I considered removing some of my old, cringe-worthy pages, but I decided that felt a bit disingenuous, so instead, they’re just tucked away behind an "old" menu. There were quite a few considerations and changes that went with the swap, and I'll try to write another post about that soon.
