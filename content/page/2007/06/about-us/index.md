The site was started with the premise of simple gaining a foothold on the web.
It has grown and changed vastly since it's first inception;

<table border="0" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><a title="site" name="site"></a><strong>Site history</strong><div></div>

There are a couple of ways to count the versions of the site but this is the one I prefer;
<li>The website was started back in 1998, out of a random desire to get a personal foothold on the internet, as a tiny randomly changing content website, based on free hosts, whilst in High School.
That was when it was basically just a cheat page (one of the thousands). It then evolved to the first 'real' version where it gained something thus far never thought of before..... content.</li>
<li>Version 1, was HTML based, and gained a few games, a forum and some random titbits for various games, still based out of free hosts. Towards the end of version 1 it also became base of operations for the radio station we tried our hand at.
It was dubbed version 2 of the site but can't really be counted as the second version.</li>
<li>Then version 2 happened, with its new spangly PHPNuke based system, which served as a better base for radio presenters to pass news on, or at least that was the idea. Then time on the part of presenters became and issue and I couldn't justify keeping the station running, but the site remained
This version of the site didn't last very long but still get's it's own version as it was a part of the development of LB's Lair as it is now.</li>
<li>And then the hack on the PHPNuke system happened, and we ended up with version 3, powered by PostNuke (the much securer fork of PHPNuke).
About this point I also progressed(?) onto University and teamed up with a new set of content providers.
Since 3.0 we had a site theme redesign, and the addition of a new gallery system and a few other tweak. I belive it to be something like 3.2 since we upgraded to the latest security release and added various bits.
And now we are faced with the concept of creating regular amount of content for the site.</li>
<li>The site then moved onto Joomla! which made handling and maintaining the site much easier.
It was dubbed version 4.0 of the site</li>
<li>At the end of May / beginning of June I suffered a major hack attempt on the site. I lost everything; email, databases, files, archives, all gone, unfortunatly I missed my backups and my hosts made a backup just after it occured, and before I noticed.</li>
<li>This has had a two fold effect, I lost the original version 4.0 of the site, but can now recreate 4.1 totally from scratch.
So a new theme and a slightly different feel of content is probably in order.

<strong>Role:</strong> Administrator

Enjoys spending vast majorities of his time gaming on almost every genre of game, bar sports. Can usually be found immersing himself in RPG realms, or otherwise fragging a lot of things at high speed.
<div></div>
Despite being the administrator of LB's Lair, he normally manages to distrct himself sufficiantly that work on the site rarely ever gets done.
(Although he can usually be brought round by waving Â£40 under his nose <img src="images/smiley-tongue-out.gif" alt="">)<table border="0" width="85%" align="center" bgcolor="#222233">

<strong>Role:</strong> Gun for hire and random 'behind-the-scenes' work (Partially Active)
<strong>Data:</strong> Very much the 'odd job man' both IRL and on site. Has a want for anything that goes boom and projects small bits of plastic or metal very fast.Very randomly introduced himself to Longbow, during Sixth Form (2 years before Univercity for those not in the UK), mistaking him for a Japanese exchange student. Ever since has been entrusted with a support role, both in RL and on LB's Lair. Usually found twiddling with random mechanical objects or playing an FPS.
<div></div>
Doesn't do anything majorly visibly on the website, apart from the odd post or review, but will usually cast a eye over everything once, before it goes live, in an attempt by both himself and Longbow to keep LB's Lair consistant.
He is also the one among us with safety qualifications thus allowing us to do some rather crazy/stupid things and not die.

<div></div>
all of the above is true, including the fact i actually hold a variety of safety qualifications. no i don't know how either, since as of writing this i have a severely bruised spine due to sand-dune based idiocy. go figure. i also enjoy smut in large amounts, industrial artworks (musical and canvas), hacking about the wilderness. i love my guns, only a little less than i love my girlfriend. and i love living in this house with the guys. its demented, filthy, and fun.

<strong>Role:</strong> Proof-reader / lurker (Partially Active)
<strong>Data:</strong> Discovered through one of Longbow's mates from Univercity, and has since proved to be of much use, providing much needed proof checks for the site, work and ideas. All of which usually leads to something interesting.
Can usually be found, rebuilding various airsoft weapons, playing EvE / Warhammer 40K (table-top), or jamming out on various electric guitars.

<table border="0" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name:</strong> Ryugen
<strong>Role:</strong> Fan fiction writer and forum lurker (Inactive)
<strong>Data:</strong> Write fan fiction in his spare time and is a hardcore gamer. Has a great want for chocolate and 'bone idle' probably does not do this man justice.
<div></div>
Randomly brought on the scene a year after Vegellamy and Mortis appeared. Will occationally vent on the forums. Enjoys playing almost every game in existance, with the exception of some Sports titles. Can always be found sleeping, eating or gaming (either on a console in the front room or on the new PC).
<div></div>
Whilst probably being the most qualified among us to write reviews, doesn't as he is likely one of the laziest men on Earth. Would post fan fictions but he hasn't finished any as of writing. And like the rest of us, everytime something is mentioned about the site, the idea is lost as soon as he sits in front of the PC.

<strong>Role:</strong> Graphics Artist and Content provider (Inactive)
<strong>Data:</strong> Graphic artist and consultant for LB's Lair. Has every trait of the average housecat.Found by Longbow, being a bum and a lazy student during a gathering at Univercity, and immeadiatly dragged into involvement. Enjoys spending most of his time goofing off, playing FPS's or 'hack-and-slash' RPG's and occasionally can be found down the pub (when he has money), has also started to take up guitar.
<div></div>
When prodded with a sharp pointy stick will sometimes actually do work, but like Longbow (and cats), gets distracted easily.

<strong>Role:</strong> Content provider and forum lurker (Inactive)
<strong>Data:</strong> Occationally provides content for LB's Lair, normally in the form of amusing photo's. Has a nasty habit of being too tall for everything around him.Found next to Vegellamy at the same gathering, and slowly became interested in doing random bits as a small personal side-project. Usually found either becoming one with an RPG or randomly jamming on the electric guitar.
<div></div>
Would probably do work on the website, except everytime anyone reminds him, by the time he's gone back to his PC, he's imersed in an RPG again, and the idea is promptly lost.
