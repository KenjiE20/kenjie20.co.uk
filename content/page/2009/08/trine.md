_Trine_ is a side scrolling platformer, given a thoroughly modern twist, with fantastic visuals. The use of physics, gives an added angle to gameplay as you can solve each level in a multitude of ways.

Characters and Story

You play as one of three characters, a thief, a knight and a magician, bound together (whether they like it or not) by a mysterious magical artifact. The three together cover, the basic character archetypes; light magical, medium agile ranged and heavy aggressor. Okay, it's not the most original story ever, but it gets the job done.

One nice thing, however, is during load screens you get treated to a wonderfully well written and voiced narration of each levels prelude.

Gameplay

_Trine_ is mix of Hack'n'Slash combat, and movement puzzles, which,Â  naturally, become more elaborate as you progress. Coupled with the ability to freely switch between each of the three characters at any time, means there's never a dull moment. The addition of the PhysX physics system makes for some interesting sections, often with quite creative solutions, depending on how you choose to play.
